# Communication-Network-Final-Project
The project is divided into 3 parts:<br>
* Part 1 - Server side and client side in Python, which keeps track of sent messages and finally returns status on how much was sent and how much was lost.<br>
* Part 2 - Client side and server side in C ++ / C, using the IPv4 & IPv6 protocol.<br>
* Part 3 - Computer communication system, you can send messages directly between computers as well as Broadcast messages which help to send a message indirectly using algorithms of finding the shortest route. (C/C++).
